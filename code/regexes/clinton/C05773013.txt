Pakistan's Roller-Coaster Economy:
Tax Evasion Stifles Growth
S AKBAR ZAIDI
Visiting Scholar, South Asia Program

SUMMARY
Over the last sixty years, Pakistan's economy has seen severe ups and downs. Once considered a model for
other developing nations, Pakistan has been unable to sustain solid growth. Furthermore, a third of its
population now lives below the poverty line, and its literacy rate is abysmally low.
Pakistan's economic instability stems in large part from low government revenue resulting from the elite's
use of tax evasions, loopholes, and exemptions. Fewer than three million of Pakistan's 175 million citizens pay
any income taxes, and the country's tax-to-GDP ratio is only 9 percent. Tax evasion means fewer resources are
available for essential social services.
Pakistan spends too much on defense and too little on development: It has spent twice as much on defense
during peacetime as it has on education and health combined.
The government knows how to increase its revenue through tax reform, but the rich and powerful have
resisted such measures for fear of lowering their own incomes.
Without sufficient revenue the government will continue to be burdened with an unsustainable debt. It needs
to end tax exemptions for the wealthy and develop broader, long-term economic plans for sustainable growth.
In the past, the United States and other Western nations have come to Pakistan's rescue by paying off debts
and funding development initiatives. Pakistan's elite has no reason to support reform as long as these bailouts
come with no conditions attached.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
S. Akbar Zaidi is a visiting scholar
in the Carnegie Endowment's
South Asia Program. Currently a
visiting professor at Columbia
University with a joint appointment in the School of
International Public Affairs and
MESAAS, the Department of
Middle Eastern, South Asian, and
African Studies, his research
focuses on development,
governance, and political
economy in South Asia. Zaidi
taught economics at the
University of Karachi from 1983
to 1996 before becoming a
visiting scholar at the University
of Oxford (1998) and later a
research fellow at the University
of Pennsylvania's Institute for the
Advanced Study of India in New
Delhi (2002-2003). From 2004 to
2005 he was a visiting professor
at the School of Advanced
International Studies (SAIS), Johns
Hopkins, and in 2008 he was a
Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow
at the National Endowment for
Democracy. Zaidi's next book,
Military, Civil Society and
Democratization in Pakistan, is to be
published by Vanguard Press,
Lahore, in October 2010.

Once heralded as a beacon for other developing countries, Pakistan's economy bears little
worthy of emulation today. For years now,
it has fluctuated wildly between periods of
impressive growth and dismal slumps. While
political competition between the military and civilian politicians has been partly
responsible for this instability, Pakistan's lack
of a proper tax and revenue regime has resulted in high rates of tax evasion, burdening the
country with unsustainable debt and undermining its development priorities. Pakistan's
politics may recently have taken a turn for
the better with the strengthening of democratic institutions and the judiciary, but the
key to the country's economic prosperity—
even its survival—is a far-reaching program
of tax reform.
A TOPSY-TURVY PAST

On January 18, 1965 the New York Times
wrote: "Pakistan may be on its way toward"
economic success "that so far has been
reached by only one other populous country,
the United States." A year later the London
Times struck a similar enthusiastic note,
saying that "the survival and development
of Pakistan is one of the most remarkable

examples of state and nation building in the
post-war period."
Forty years later, the press was offering
a very different bouquet of sobriquets to
describe Pakistan. International newspapers
and magazines called it "the most dangerous place in the world," a "failed state," and a
‘`rogue state with a nuclear arsenal," to name
just a few. Only a few decades before, several
far less developed countries, such as South
Korea, Malaysia, China and India, were considered far less likely than Pakistan to survive,
much less thrive. Today, all of those countries
and others have surged ahead of Pakistan
economically.
Pakistan didn't fall behind because it
stood still; rather, its economic history spans
six decades of roller coaster ups and downs.
The first decade, 1947-1958, was one of
"settling down," in which the new country
comprising East and West Pakistan emerged
from British India. The second period,
1958-1968, was marked by the rule of
General Muhammad Ayub Khan and is now
known as the Decade of Development for its
high growth rates. Accompanying those high
growth rates, however, were high income and
regional inequality, which contributed to the

In 1971 a new Pakistan emerged under
the government of the left-of-center Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto. Nationalization of private businesses and public sector—led development
were the norm for the new regime. Growth
was relatively low compared to the decades
before and after, but adequate under the
dire and constrained circumstances of the

time. Following Bhutto's ouster in 1977,
General Muhammad Zia ul-Haq inaugurated
Pakistan's fourth "era," ruling until 1988. Zia's
era saw the return of high growth rates, but
it also saw the role of the military increase
greatly in the economy, politics, foreign policy and in society more generally. Zia's death
brought a period of active civilian politics and
electioneering. "Democracy" is perhaps too
generous a term for this process. There were

For example, the severe debt burden had
been the single most important attribute of
Pakistan's economy through the 1990s. Overall
outstanding debt was equal to GDP, and foreign debt servicing alone in 2001-2002 was
as much as 10 percent of GDP. Excessive tax
evasion was the primary cause of this.
After 9/11, however, the Musharraf regime
was able to sign agreements with bilateral and
multinational donors to write off or reschedule huge amounts of this debt, giving them
unprecedented fiscal space. This fiscal freedom was the main reason the economy turned
around so sharply. Growth rose to 7.5 percent
in 2003-2004 until maxing out the following year at 9 percent, the highest level in two
decades. The fiscal deficit was near its lowest
level in almost two decades, remittances were at
historic highs, and exports crossed the $17 billion mark for the first time and showed signs of

further growth. By 2006-2007, domestic debt
had fallen to 30 percent of GDP, and foreign
debt servicing was less than 5 percent of GDP.
The government claimed that the economy
had rebounded, that there had been a "turnaround," and that good times of high growth
and high human development had returned.
Even the stock market soared to unprecedented
levels, shattering records weekly.
Moreover, at some point between 2002
and 2004, Pakistan joined those ninety
or so countries that the United Nations
Development Programme's (UNDP) Human
Development Report (HDR) puts in the category of "Medium Human Development."
From the time of the first annual HDR in
1990, Pakistan had consistently been classified as one of the forty or so countries in the
"Low Human Development" category. (By

When civilians regained power, they tended
to blame the military for Pakistan's problems,

ening them and thus creating the rationale for
the military to intervene. The extremely short
tenures of Pakistan's elected governments left
them no opportunities to craft long-term
strategies.
The experiences of Pakistan's neighbor
India provide an important point of comparison here. The Indian electorate rejected the
"India shining" slogans of the Bharatiya Janata

Party (BJP)—led government of 1999-2004
in favor of a Congress-led government. Yet
despite the intense antagonism between the
Congress Party and the BJP, the political transition was a smooth one. Of course, India is a
mature democracy whereas Pakistan's has had
little opportunity to grow, but the example
nevertheless shows that smooth political transitions and high growth rates are not entirely
foreign to the region.
Pakistan's frequent regime changes aren't
the only reason that the country has never
been able to engage in long-term planning. It
is also possible that the system itself, regardless
of whether civilians or the military are at the
helm, encourages the rentier mentality. Recent
events related to profiteers hoarding wheat
and sugar, for example, suggest that corruption continues to enjoy support from key
elements of Pakistan's society. Such systemic

Subject: recognition of USG assistance/contributions.
We all agree that there is a need to dramatically increase the awareness level of USG assistance efforts around the
world. Following up on conversations with Melanne and others, I would like to suggest that we begin the effort by
bringing together a small group of people from inside and outside government to help us think this through. USAID
participation will be crucial. I'd be happy to organize this and/or co-host the event with you . Let me know what you
think.

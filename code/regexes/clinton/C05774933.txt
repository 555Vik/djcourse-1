I am headed back from China and I do not have S' email but I wanted to pass on this info regarding Father Charlie Beirne,
a friend to both of us and frmr Prez of LeMoyne College who is now at a hospice at Fordham University in the Bronx. He
greatly admires S and they always had a special relationship. We had planned for him to come down and have lunch w
us (incldg Mark Landler of the NYT who I have informed).
Charlie called me last night and he is stoic and brave but I think he would appreciate a call from S - who is simply admires
This is a Jesuit that showed his bravery by calling the Secy General of the Jesuits to ask to replace his Jesuit friend who
had been massacred (along w others) by the military at a University in Central America.

Dear Trustees and Trustee Associates,
I am writing to share an update on Fr. Beirne's health. Fr. Beirne called this morning to let me know that his cancer has
reached a stage where he has made the decision not to have any further clinical intervention. He prefers to live out the
time he has remaining, six months by the doctors' projections, without the sapping of his energy and other side effects
posed by his recent treatments. I have his permission to share this sad news with you. You may write to Fr. Beirne at
Murray-Weigel Hall where he is now living (see address below) or phone him on his cell phone at
Murray-Weigel Hall
515 E. Fordham Road
Bronx, NY 10458-5029

I am sure that you join me in offering prayers for Fr. Beirne as he faces the challenges his illness presents in his final
months with us.
Sincerely,
Fred P. Pestello, Ph.D.

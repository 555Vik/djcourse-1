Call followup

Sen. Tester--Pls ask someone on Michele Bond's team to call Jamie Wise on Sen. Tester's staff to explain our orphan
procedures. The Senator said he had about 15 families who had gone thru the adoption process.
Pls add Stephanie Miner and Jack Mannion to a guest list for a future event at State.
Also, Jack Rosen still wants a mtg sometime in the future. So ask Lona just to add him to a list but not schedule it.

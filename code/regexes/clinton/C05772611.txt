HRON1C DISEASES ARE THE

largest cause of death in the
world (FIGURE 1), led by cardiovascular disease (17 million deaths in 2002, mainly from ischemic heart disease and stroke) and
followed by cancer (7 million deaths),
chronic lung diseases (4 million), and
diabetes mellitus (almost 1 million).'
These leading diseases share key risk
factors: tobacco use, unhealthful diets, lack of physical activity, and alcohol use (TABLE)." The current burden
of chronic diseases reflects past exposure to these risk factors, and the future burden will be largely determined by current exposures.
The global prevalence of all the leading chronic diseases is increasing, with
the majority occurring in developing
countries and projected to increase substantially over the next 2 decades (Figure 1).3 Cardiovascular disease is already the leading cause of mortality in
developing countries (FIGURE 2).1 Between 1990 and 2020, mortality from ischemic heart disease in developing countries is expected to increase by 120% for
women and 137% for men.' Predictions for the next 2 decades include a
. near tripling of ischemic heart disease
and stroke mortality in Latin America,
the Middle East, and sub-Saharan Africa.
The global number of individuals with
diabetes in 2000 was estimated to be 171
million (2.8% of the world's population),
a figure projected to increase in 2030 to
366 million (6.5%), 298 million of whom

Chronic diseases are the largest cause of death in the world. In 2002, the
leading chronic diseases—cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes—caused 29 million deaths worldwide. Despite
growing evidence of epidemiological and economic impact, the global response to the problem remains inadequate. Stakeholders include governments, the World Health Organization and other United Nations bodies, academic and research groups, nongovernmental organizations, and the private
sector. Lack of financial support retards capacity development for prevention, treatment, and research in most developing countries. Reasons for this
include that up-to-date evidence related to the nature of the burden of chronic
diseases is not in the hands of decision makers and strong beliefs persist
that chronic diseases afflict only the affluent and the elderly, that they arise
solely from freely acquired risks, and that their control is ineffective and too
expensive and should wait until infectious diseases are addressed. The influence of global economic factors on chronic disease risks impedes progress,
as does the orientation of health systems toward acute care. We identify 3
policy levers to address these impediments: elevating chronic diseases on
the health agenda of key policymakers, providing them with better evidence about risk factor control, and persuading them of the need for health
systems change. A more concerted, strategic, and multisectoral policy approach, underpinned by solid research, is essential to help reverse the negative trends in the global incidence of chronic disease.

GLOBAL BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASES

til high levels of wealth and literacy are
reached, whereupon governments are
more likely to respond to public health
concerns and use a broad range of
policy instruments to influence consumption trends. The global challenge policymakers face is how to
implement policies now that support
continued economic development while
simultaneously reducing the rates of increase of chronic diseases.
KEY PLAYERS' POLICY
RESPONSES TO
THE GLOBAL BURDEN
OF CHRONIC DISEASES

Although many key groups have responded to the infectious disease burdens of developing nations, they have
not responded to the expanded chronic
disease burden.
Heads of State

Heads of state of the G8 countries recognized health as a global challenge at
their Summit in 2000, acknowledging
that health is the "key to prosperity"
and that "poor health drives poverty."" The G8 leaders agreed to

mobilize resources, ultimately leading
to the establishment of the Global
Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and
Malaria.20 No subsequent commitment
has yet been made for chronic diseases.
Similarly, the G77, representing heads
of state from approximately 130 developing countries, recently discussed global
health issues.2' Their focus was communicable diseases although they did support the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control—a reversal for many G77
members, who previously feared reduced tobacco consumption would negatively affect their farmers." The G77 have
also expressed concerns that efforts to reduce sugar consumption might harm
their economies!'
Health Ministries

The capacity of 185 countries to prevent and treat chronic diseases was recently assessed by the World Health Organization (WHO)." Although there was
a high level of awareness about chronic
diseases among health ministry officials, this was not supported by comprehensive policies and budgets to develop

Human Immunodeficiency Virus/AIDS

integrated approaches to their prevention, surveillance, and control. Thirtynine percent of countries reviewed had
budget lines for chronic diseases. Only
a few developing countries have committed significant resources to chronic
disease control."
World Health Organization

Many of WHO's functions are directly
related to chronic disease control. WHO
member states first requested action on
chronic diseases in 1956 when India proposed a resolution on cardiovascular disease and hypertension at the Ninth World
Health Assembly." Subsequently, member states from both developed and developing countries have demanded action
on chronic diseases, including the global
strategy on "Prevention and Control of
Non-communicable Diseases" in 2000°5
and a resolution and subsequent strategy on "Diet, Physical Activity and
Health" in 2002-2004.2' The landmark
resolution on the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 20032' was
the first time WFIO used its constitutional treaty-making right to address a
global public health threat.
With the important exception of tobacco control, WHO's financial resources for chronic disease control are
small. WHO Headquarters spends only
$0.50 on chronic diseases (all noncommunicable diseases except for mental
health) per death per person compared with $7.50 for leading communicable diseases.28

GLOBAL BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASES
a international tobacco seminar in its introductory global health course, the primary focus remains on infectious diseases and primary health care.
International committees convened by
the Global Forum on Health Research
recommend that greater support be given
to chronic disease research specific to
developing countries." Yet the exponential growth of funding over the past
decades has not been proportionally allocated to the growing burden of chronic
disease.31 Most research support focuses
on infectious diseases.3='" A recent review
showed that total health research funds
spent on chronic diseases was only 7.4%
in Cuba, 2.3% in Kazakhstan, and 14.4%
in the Philippines?'
Nevertheless, there are efforts to focus more research on chronic diseases. The Fogarty International Center has begun to allocate one third of
its resources to chronic disease research and training programs in the developing world." Research funding
agencies in India, Mexico, and South
Africa are devoting increasing budgetary resources to chronic diseases."-"
Important insights into policies needed
to strengthen research capability for
chronic diseases in developing nations can be gained from experiences
in tropical disease research and training over the past 3 decades."
Donors

Although official development assistance for health has increased in the past
5 years, these trends have been almost
entirely absorbed by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS in subSaharan Africa (Catherine M. Michaud,
MD, PhD, written communication,
October 2003). Bilateral aid agencies
rarely prioritize chronic disease or
related risk factors.'" Official Overseas
Development Aid to the health sector
in 2002 reached $2.9 billion, of which
0.1% was officially allocated to chronic
diseases (including mental health;
Catherine M. Michaud, MD, PhD, written communication, March 2004). The
true figure may be higher since about
30% of Overseas Development Aid to
health goes to basic health services, of

which a proportion would benefit
chronic disease control.
Private investment in global health far
exceeds government assistance, but most
target infectious diseases and humanitarian needs. There has been modest support for tobacco control from the UN
Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Soros Foundations,41.42 but
this is now declining. The Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation does not include chronic diseases in its portfolio."
Although several US foundations support innovative domestic chronic disease research and training programs, they
provide little support for such programs internationally.
World Bank and Regional
Development Banks

Although the World Bank recognizes
the increasing burden of chronic diseases on the poor, it has no comprehensive chronic disease policy. Over the
last 5 years, it provided $4.25 billion
in loans to countries for health sector
work, about 2.5% of which was allocated to "noncommunicable disease
prevention and control" programs, all
in eastern Europe (Catherine M. Michaud, MD, PhD, written communication, March 2004).
The lack of an integrated approach to
chronic diseases is reflected by the Bank's
Poverty Strategy Reduction Papers, which
are intended to guide investment priorities to reduce poverty in the poorest
countries in the world. However, the Poverty Strategy Reduction Papers present
no strategies to address chronic diseases, and in particular smoking."
The Regional Development Banks
have policies on health, but only the
Asian Development Bank includes
chronic diseases."' This policy has been
met by minimal spending commitments. A review carried out for the Asian
Development Bank in 1999 recommends that subsidies for chronic diseases would be better spent on the prevention and treatment of communicable
diseases."' The rationale was that the cost
of treating chronic disease is most likely
to accrue to individuals and, as such,
should be left to the private market.

Global Nongovernmental
Organizations

Nationally, nongovernmental organizations (NG0s) are reported to play a
variety of roles in chronic disease control, but their precise roles and effectiveness are not well known.23 Internationally, NGOs proved critical in
the development of the Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control."
Nongovernmental organizations have
a wide geographic spread and have
the ability to build capacity. Yet overall, there has been no concerted effort
on chronic diseases by NG0s. Nongovernmental organizations concerned with diet and nutrition in
developed countries have not built
capacity in developing countries.
International consumer group input is
inadequate. Initiatives such as "sustainable development" and "corporate
social responsibility" have not been
applied to Chronic diseases.
Health and Development
Initiatives

United Nations health and development reports play a major role in
setting priorities for global health. Persistent problems that hinder development, such as infant and maternal mortality, malnutrition, and HIV/AIDS have
received priority in the poorest countries. But the emphasis on communicable diseases has excluded consideration of chronic diseases in lowmiddle and middle income countries.
The Millennium Development Goals are
illustrative in this respect. Millennium Development Goal 6 is to "Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases."4 Although the other diseases
category theoretically includes chronic
diseases, in practice, they are ignored.
The UN Population Fund does not
mention chronic diseases in its strategy on population and development"'
and UN Children's Fund's recent goalsetting program, "A World Fit for Children" does not include risk factors for
chronic conditions among the 25 action points proposed to "promote
healthy lives" despite strong evidence
to the contrary."

GLOBAL BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASES

Reasons for Neglect: Impediments
to Control Global Chronic Diseases

In most developing countries inadequate financing and lack of manpower to address chronic diseases have
been major impediments to chronic disease control. Other impediments are the
failure to provide key decision makers
with up-to-date evidence on the burden of chronic diseases: a lack of understanding of the economic factors that
influence chronic disease risks; and the
current orientation of health systems toward acute care.
Up-to-Date Evidence Is Not in the
Hands of Key Decision Makers

Many key decision makers still believe that chronic diseases afflict only
the affluent and the elderly and arise
only from freely acquired risks and that
their control is ineffective and too expensive and should wait until infectious diseases are addressed.
These beliefs are based on a misunderstanding of the chronic disease burden. In developed countries, the relationship between socioeconomic
inequalities and many chronic diseases and their risk factors are well described." Although the disease burden is more variable in developing
countries, the poorest populations, particularly in rapidly growing cities, in
many cases already exhibit the highest risks for tobacco use, alcohol use,
and physical activity, with evidence
emerging for obesity.5254 This will lead
to a higher burden of chronic diseases
over the long-term. Poverty also leads
to greater comorbidity and decreased
access to quality medical care.
Chronic diseases in developing countries are not just diseases of the elderly, since cardiovascular disease accounts for as many deaths in young and
middle-agerfadults as HIWAIDS.' Also,
in developing countries chronic diseases affect a much higher proportion
of people during their prime working
years than in developed countries. Male
deaths during middle age could create
a significant cohort of widows, which
increases the likelihood that women will
live out their final years in poverty.'
2620

Many decision makers mistakenly believe that chronic diseases arise only as
a result of the irresponsibility of the individuals who contract them, with the
perception that "smoking is a free choice
with health consequences."" Yet age and
uptake of smoking in developing countries are showing a trend toward early
teenage years,' the stage of life when the
addictiveness of tobacco belies freedom of choice. Tobacco marketing is often targeted specifically at children," alcohol advertisements shape young
peoples' perceptions and encourage prodrink attitudes," and food marketing
works its way "into the skin" of children and adolescents." There will always be a tension between the role of individuals vs the role of government, but
it is clear that governments (and industry) must take some responsibility."
Chronic disease control is not necessarily expensive or ineffective. For example, a recent review of tobacco control in Brazil, South Africa, Thailand,
Poland, Bangladesh, and Canada showed
that tobacco prevalence can be reduced cost-effectively in high-, middle-,
and low-income countries.' Several
clinical and public health interventions have the potential to reduce the
burden of disease from cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, and hypertension significantly and at low cost.' There is, however, an urgent need to develop best
practices for obesity control.
The belief that scarce resources should
not be used for chronic diseases until infectious diseases are addressed is also fallacious. Several infectious agents cause
cancer?; tobacco increases deaths from
tuberculosis in already infected populations,' and antiretroviral regimens in
HIV-infected patients increase the risk
of heart disease.' Better tobacco control would reduce tuberculosis mortality, and new vaccines could reduce the
prevalence of cervical cancer and perhaps other cancers.
Economic Factors Influence
Chronic Disease Risks

At a macroeconomic level, it is often assumed that global economic development increases income and subse-

JANIA, June 2, 2004—Vol 291, No. 21 (Reprinted)

quently improves all aspects of health
in developing countries. Yet, although
greater economic investment and higher
incomes among some groups have
eased some of the health challenges in
developing countries, chronic diseases have been exacerbated.'
Important drivers here are urbanization, trade, foreign investment, and promotional marketing. More open conditions for trade and foreign investment
can bring economic benefits, but also
encourage unhealthful behavior risks."
Several of the world's top 100 nonfinancial transnational corporations
ranked by foreign assets in 2000 are associated with chronic disease risk factors, including tobacco, food, and automobile companies.64 These companies
all invest heavily in marketing their
products,"'" which, if unregulated, encourages acquisition of the risk factors for chronic diseases.
Lobbyists for tobacco, sugar, and other
food interests have diverted attention
from the need to address consumption
patterns that drive chronic diseases, and
their views have become the accepted
position of many policytnakers." Some
companies and their trade associations
have actively tried to thwart introduction of regulations and effective advocacy in advancing tobacco control."
Sugar lobbyists have been effective in
having their messages that "sugar doesn't
harm health—but less sugar consumption harms their economies" accepted by
some governments despite evidence to
the contrary.67
Health Systems Are Not Oriented
Toward Managing Chronic
Diseases

Acute problems, such as certain infectious diseases and maternal and child
care, have been the principal focus of
health care systems." Although infectious diseases continue to be a threat
in many developing :countries, their
health systems now must address a
double burden of chronic and acute
conditions.
The chronic disease management
model is more complex than that required for acute problems, such as

many infectious diseases." It entails
multiple causes over a lifetime and a
more horizontal and integrated approach, with patient, family, and the
community being active participants.
Chronic care has tended to screen
high-risk individuals with a high probability of contracting chronic diseases. Yet for chronic diseases, most risk
factors are widely distributed in the
population, with all individuals at risk
but differing in the extent of their risk.69
Prevention and treatment therefore requires a sustained, multisectoral commitment well beyond the traditional
health sector. This model is also required for communicable diseases such
as HIV/AIDS, since antiretroviral
therapy must be taken for life."
TOWARD THE
FUTURE-LEVERING
LONG-TERM CHANGE

The rising global burden of chronic diseases needs stronger leadership by
policy makers, advocates, and health
professionals.
Placing Chronic Diseases Higher on
the Political and Health Agenda

Decision makers need to be fully informed with the up-to-date evidence
about the burden and impacts of
chronic diseases. Clearer messages on
chronic diseases are needed and the advocacy base expanded. Gaps in our
knowledge about chronic disease control should be tackled using a "grand
challenges in i tiative."71
Controlling Risk Factors
for Chronic Diseases

The negative impacts of global economic development can be ameliorated through multisectoral action to
tackle chronic diseases upstream. Policy
leaders need to encourage transnational corporations to improve health
while also making a profit by putting
in place new business models, such as
those being developed by Unilever
(Paulus Verschuen and Harry jongeneelan, written communication, May
13,2004) and Novo Nordisk SA.7' They
should also encourage the creation of

codes and incentives for healthy foreign investment in developing countries and incorporating chronic diseases into accountability initiatives such
as the UN Global Compact."
The role of government is critical to
the development and implementation
of well grounded risk-factor control
programs such as the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which also has implications for
food policies." Age-specific death rates
from the leading chronic diseases in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries have
declined as a result of governmental and
civil society action against tobacco use,
emphasis on maintaining healthful life
styles, and access to treatments.4 Over
the last decade, increased longevity has
been accompanied by a compression of
morbidity: in the United States, disability rates in people older than 65 years
have decreased 2% a year while mortality rates have declined by 1%."
Governments can play a role by altering economic incentives for business and
individuals. Expanding markets for fruit
and vegetables will allow developing
countries to gain from increased export earnings and consumption. Raising the tobacco excise tax to levels that
will reduce consumption effectively"
will increase government revenue and
reduce the burden of disease.
Health System Realignment

Health systems should be realigned to accommodate diagnosis, secondary prevention, and primary prevention of
chronic diseases. Governments need to
support this transformation if they are
to realize significant health gains. In an
approach that has international applications, the United Kingdom Government Treasury has recommended a set
of clear health targets and objectives for
the nation based on scenarios." The new
financing opportunities for chronic infectious diseases like H1V/AIDS and tuberculosis create a chance to build integrated systems in the poorest countries.

lighted by several academics4.'668 but
needs to be translated into action.
We are now at a critical juncture with
respect to the global health agenda. Coordinated and focused emphasis on
chronic disease is essential to address
the enormity of the burden of those who
now survive beyond childhood around
the world.
